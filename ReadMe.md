## Parallel Computing Matrix Multiply Assignment

To run this lab, simply run multiply.py. The results and time will be printed through the terminal. With the current code, we have matrices size 200 with values 3 and 5 repectively. 

This repository contains some basic Python utilities for
matrix operations. This is also the repository where
you will submit the assignment.
